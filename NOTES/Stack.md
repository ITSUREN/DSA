# ðŸ“¦ Stack
- A linear Data Structure.
- A special type of [List](./List.md) or [Linked List](./Linked_List.md).
- Data may be inserted and deleted only of the top of the stack. 
- LIFO [Last In First Out]

### ðŸ”§ Operations on a Stack:
1. Push: Adds an element to the top of the Stack.
2. Pop: Returns and deletes an item fromt eh top of the Stack.
6. Traverse: Displays the content of the Stack.

### ðŸŒ¿ Types Implementation
1. **[List Implementation](./Stack_List.md)**
2. **[Linked List Implementation](./Stack_LinkedList.md)**

# ðŸ§° Applications
- Stack may be used in the Conversion between prefix, infix and postfix Operations and Evaluation of these Expressions.
- Expressions are Mathematical Statements consisting of **Operands** and **Operators**
- Expression here are of three types.
    1. **Prefix**:
    - Expressions where Operator Preceedes two operands.
    - example: 
    ```
    +-*$ABCD//EF+GH
    ```
    2. **Infix**:
    - Expressions where Operator is between two operands.
    - example:
    ```
    A+B-C/D
    ```
    3. **Postfix**:
    - Expressions where Operator follows the two operands.
    - example:
    ```
    ABC+*CBA-+*
    ```

- The use cases are as follows
