#  ðŸ”€ Sorting Algorithms
- Agorithms to order the elements in an array in specific order

### ðŸŒ¿ Nature of Sorting Algorithms:
- The Sorting Algorithm can be any of the folllowing natures:
1. ### In-Place Sorting Algorithms
    - Rearranges the elements of an array or a list within the memory space it already occupies.
    - Doesnt require additional space proportional to the size of the input. 
    - Examples:
    1. Insertion Sort
    2. Selection Sort
    3. Quick Sort (Modified)
    4. Heap Sort
    5. Shell Sort
    - What are not In-Place Sorting Algorithms
    1. Merge Sort
    2. Counting Sort
    3. Bubble Sort
    4. Radix Sort
2. ### Stable sorting Algorithms
    - Relative order of equal elements in the sorted output remains the same as their order in the original input.
    - Examples:
    1. Insertion Sort
    2. Merge Sort
    3. Radix Sort
    4. Counting Sort
    - What are not In-Place Sorting Algorithms
    1. Heap Sort
    2. Bubble Sort
    3. Selection Sort
    4. Shell Sort (may depend upon application)
    5. Selection Sort (may depend upon application)
3. Internal Sorting Algorithms
    - Those that operate entirely withing the main Memory.
    - Examples:
    1. Insertion Sort
    2. Selection Sort
    3. Quick Sort
    4. Merge Sort
    5. Bubble Sort
4. External Sorting Algorithms
    - designed to handle datasets that are too large to fit entirely into the available memory and must be stored on external storage devices, such as hard drives or solid-state drives (SSDs)
    - Example:
    1. External Merge Sort
    2. Polyphase Merge Sort
