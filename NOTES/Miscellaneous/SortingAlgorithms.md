#  ðŸ”€ Sorting Algorithms
- Algorithms to order the elements in an array in a specific order

### ðŸŒ¿ Nature of Sorting Algorithms:
- The Sorting Algorithm can be any of the following natures:
1. ### In-Place Sorting Algorithms
    - Rearranges the elements of an array or a list within the memory space it already occupies.
    - Doesn't require additional space proportional to the size of the input. 
    - Examples:

        | In-Place          | Not In-Place      |
        | :---------------- | ----------------: |
        | Bubble Sort       | Merge Sort        |
        | Selection Sort    | Radix Sort        |
        | Insertion Sort    | Counting Sort     |
        | Quick Sort        |                   |
        | Heap Sort (Modded)|                   |
        | Shell Sort        |                   | 
2. ### Stable sorting Algorithms
    - Relative order of equal elements in the sorted output remains the same as their order in the original input.
    - Examples:

        | Stable            | Not Stable                            |
        | :---------------- | ----------------:                     |
        | Bubble Sort       | Quick Sort                            |
        | Selection Sort    | Heap Sort                             |
        | Insertion Sort    | Shell Sort (depends on gap sequence)  |
        | Merge Sort        |                                       |
        | Radix Sort        |                                       |
        | Counting Sort     |                                       |
3. Internal Sorting Algorithms
    - Those that operate entirely within the main Memory.
    - Examples:
    1. Insertion Sort
    2. Selection Sort
    3. Quick Sort
    4. Merge Sort
    5. Bubble Sort
4. External Sorting Algorithms
    - designed to handle datasets that are too large to fit entirely into the available memory and must be stored on external storage devices, such as hard drives or solid-state drives (SSDs)
    - Example:
    1. External Merge Sort
    2. Polyphase Merge Sort
